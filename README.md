This repo is a collection of code snippets for people who want to start learning HTML.

I am a 29 years old guy from Germany and coding is one of my hobbies.
Feel free to contact me if you have questions, find a mistake, want to add something etc.
Besides that feel free to use the codes and play around with them to see what happens when you change something.
Maybe you will also get some errors.
That's good, because it will help you to understand what kind of errors can happen and how you can discover and fix them.
