The basic layout of a HTML5 document is as follows:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>qp tutorials</title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
  visible code goes here
  </body>
</html>

The doctype is optional, but recommended, because it tells your browser to read it as HTML5 only.
If you don't add it some browsers may try to read it as HTML4 or something and display unexpected results.
