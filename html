The <html> tags go in the first or in the second line of your code
depending if you have a <doctype> or not.

<html>

</html>

It is not necessary, but I recommend to format the <html> tag like this,
because we will add a <title> tag between the <html> tag later.
I think that improves the readability and maintenance of the code.
